-   Provide "Components are loaded on demand" / "Web page HD display" / "SVG Icon" optimization features, integrated development.
-   Use TypeScript to develop, provide type definition files, support type and attribute smart tips for easy business development.
-   Use attribute inheritance with TS to facilitate secondary encapsulation of components
-   Developed with React Hooks for superior performance
-   [Test coverage is over 80%](https://codecov.io/gh/jdthfe/edm/)

### Getting Started

> Before delving into Ant Design React, a good knowledge of React and ES2015 is needed. Make sure that you had installed Node.js(> v8.x) correctly.

#### 1. Create a New Project

Can be an existing project, or a newly created empty project with dva / create-react-app. **React version requires higher than v16.8**

#### 2. Installation

```tsx
npm install e-ui --save
```

#### 3. Usage

Example of usage:

```tsx
import { Button } from 'e-ui';
ReactDOM.render(<Button>Start</Button>, mountNode);
```

And import stylesheets manually:

```tsx
import 'e-ui/compiled/dist/index.css';
```

**Use modularized e-ui**

**Note: Strongly recommended.**

The following two ways used to load the only components you used, select one of the ways you like.

-   Manually import

```tsx
import Button from 'e-ui/compiled/lib/Button'; // for JS
import 'e-ui/compiled/lib/Button/style/css'; // for CSS
// import 'e-ui/compiled/lib/Button/style'; // that will import sass
```

If `webpack` or `rollup` is used in the project, the following is supported（Recommended）.

```tsx
import { Button } from 'e-ui';
import 'e-ui/compiled/lib/Button/style/css'; // for CSS
// import 'e-ui/compiled/dist/index.css'; // Recommend to import all styles in the entry file
```

-   Use [babel-plugin-import](https://github.com/ant-design/babel-plugin-import)。

```tsx
// .babelrc or babel-loader option
{
        "plugins": [
      [
        "import",
        {
          "libraryName": "e-ui",
          "libraryDirectory": "compiled/lib", // or "compilesed/es"
          "camel2DashComponentName": false,
          "style": "css"// `style: true` for sass
        }
      ]
    ]
}
```

This allows you to import components from antd-mobile without having to manually import the corresponding stylesheet. The babel plugin will automatically import stylesheets.

```tsx
// import js and css modularly, parsed by babel-plugin-import
import { Button } from 'e-ui';
```
